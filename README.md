# property-analysis

This program is to be used to calculate average rents and price for square foot using csv file data

The program calculates the best type of investment in property in any area.  In this case I am using data from the San Francisco housing market

The program uses Geo Location data to dertmine which neighborhoods would be the most profitable to buy for rental income.

I have included interactive maps to support the data
